    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Greetings!</p>
    <p class="indent">
      I am a recent graduate from the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida. I majored in Electrical Engineering and received my 
      bachelors degree in may of 2025. Electronics has been a long-time interest for me, so choosing to major in Electrical Engineering was an easy choice. 
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Currently I am seeking an entry level job in Electrical Engineering. I am interested in the power electronics field, a field of Electrical Engineering based
      on high power DC or AC circuits, with a large influence on robitics, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. I enjoy hands-on tasks the most, like assembling
      circuit boards or wiring, but I also enjoy computer based design processes, for example CAD or EDA  
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      I spend my spare time tinkering with things, usually electronics, sometimes other mechanical devices. Regardless of electrical or mechanical I have a desire
      to learn how things work and why things are the way that they are. Inspiration for a project usually comes from some salvaged part, I form a vision of what I think
      I can do with that part, and everything stems from there. I love the creative design process, going from a pile of parts to a finished product is fun every step of the way.
      Creating a pile of parts from a complete product is also lots of fun for me, I enjoy taking things apart as much as putting things together.
      It is a chance to learn how somebody else designed and assembled something, a chance to discover new things, and at the end of the day I have a bunch of new parts
      to be repurposed later!

    <h1>
      University of Florida
    </h1>
    <p class="indentnp">
      I graduated with my bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the university of florida in May of 2025.
    The University of Florida is a great school, during my time there I met many great people and got to experience lots of cool things. Despite the constant
    construction and periodic lack of taste in architecture, the UF campus is beutiful and packed with things to discover.
    </p>
    <p class="indentnp">
      Being a person that likes to learn by doing, the most meaningful classes that I took at UF were the design or project based ones, such as junior or senior design.
    These two classes are not like typical lecture based classes, they are self guided design projects where you are the engineer.
    There are some simple requirements to fulfill, but it is entirely on you to put the pieces together. This is something that I wish happened more in engineering classes,
    the design process is how me and lots of other students learn the best.
    </p>
    <p class="indentnp">
      Other classes that I took at UF included things like digital design or power electronics. Digital systems and power electronics are two parts or electrical engineering
    that I like working in the most, there is something satisfying about digital circuits and the ability to manipulate data and do operations with a collection of
    simple components. In a time when efficiency is more relevant than ever, the field power electronics is never dull!
    </p>
    <p class="indentnp">
      The thing that I am most proud of from my time at UF and the thing that I will look back on the most is my contributions to a research lab in the mechanical and Aerospace
    Engineering department. This lab was developing a product called the BathyDrone, with support from Aurego. The Bathydrone is a bathymetric mapping sustem in which a large
    drone tows a small unpowered vessel equiped with sidescan sonar. Every day that I spent working with the team on this project was a joy, everybody shared the same interest
    in engineering and the same desire to push the boundaries of what we were capable of.

    <h1>
      Santa Fe College
    </h1>
    <p class="indent">
      Before attending the University of Florida I took classes at Santa Fe College as part of a program called Gator Engineering at Santa Fe. The goal of the program is to allow students to
    take genED classes at SantaFe before "transferring" to UF. Although not a typical route to get to UF it had a number of benifits for me, not the least of which being the
    fact the Santa Fe costs roughly half as much as UF's in-state tuition. The other big advantage for me was smaller class sizes and a more close knit community, which really
    improved the experienc of taking difficult classes like calculus, physics, and chemistry.

    <h1>The Bathydrone</h1>
    <p class="indentnp">
      The Bathydrone is a project led by Dr. Peter Ifju and Dr. Jane Shin in the Mechanical and Merospace Mngineering department at the University of Florida.
      Together with Phd students, masters students, other faculty, and undergraduates like me, we worked on developing a new method to do bathymetry faster and
       cheaper than traditional methods. The Bathydrone gets its namesake from bathymetry and the drone that tows the vessel. This project was made possible by
        Aurigo Software technologies, a company that specializes in software for civil engineering and project management, particularly governments. 
    </p>
    <p class="indentnp">
      Displayed to the left in the middle upper and lower images are an overview of the heavy-lift drone and unpowered vessel. The drone was built in-house by students
       using carbon fiber, which makes for an airframe that is very durable an light weight. The vessel was built by laying fibergalss over a foam form to create a very precise
       shape. This shape was fine tuned over nearly half a dozen iterations to make a vessel that could plane level while being pulled from above and be resistant to
      capzising. The vessel also needed to be light since the Bathydrone system is designed with the intention that the drone can fully lift the vessel in and out of the water, 
      the latest revision of the vessel and drone weighed about 20 pounds each, putting the system near the legal FAA weight limits for this class of vehicle.   
    </p>
    <p class="indentnp">
      The Bathydrone did bathymetric mapping using a sidescan sonar for imagery and RTK corrected GPS for accurate postitioning. With these two components the imagery was post
       processed into a map of the bottom surface of the water body relative to the water surface. The sonar system used was a Lowrance HDS 11 recreational "fish finder",
       despite being recreational grade equipment is was able to provide resonable accuracy sidescan and downscan, data logging, and limited networking capabilities at a price
        far less than scientific grade sonar. For RTK GPS on the vessel we used a Pixhawk Cube Orange, which is actually a drone flight computer, but in the vessel it provided
        RTK gps as well as the ability to control the twin rudders on the rear of the vessel. The drone also uses a Pixhawk Cube flight conputer and carries two RTK capable
        GPS antennas.   
    </p>
    <p class="indentnp">
      My role in the team was primarily installing and maintaining the electrical systems of the drone and vessel. My first project was designing a device to measure and record
      the tension in the tow line between the drone and vessel. This tension data was used to supplement physics simulation of the Bathydrone in part of one Phd student's research.
      I also designed a power distribution borad (PDB) for the drone. The drone has many components that all needed different voltages to run, and the flight computer needed a way
      to monitor battery state. To achieve this I designed and built a PDB that distributes 52V battery power to each motor while also monitoring current and voltage.
      The large motor currents flowed through internal copper planes while five different high voltage DC-DC converters on top of the PDB generated voltages needed for the flight
       computer, servos, long range receiver, and navigation lights. I had never attempted a PCB design like this before, but I am proud to say that after donzens of drone flights
       not a single failure occoured related to the PDB. In addition to PDB work I did lots of soldering and wiring for the vessel, the electrical systems on the vessel were
      constantly changing as different things were tested or removed, so keeping the wiring reliable and as neat as possible was a constant challenge. Throughout my time working
      in the lab I also assisted with field testing, which involved loading equipment into a vehicle, travelling to a site, and setting up equipment before running the experiment.
      Field days rarely went the way they were planned and often took longer then planned, but part of doing research is handling problems and overcoming them as they are encountered
      , no field day was ever wasted.

    <h1>Drones for Robotic Perception</h1>
    <p class="indent">
      Displayed to the left is a pair of medium drones that I worked on for another research lab in the MAE department at UF. This lab worked in conjunction with the Bathydrone
      lab, but was mainly focused on robotic perception research. A small team of other undergrad student and I worked on a set of four of the drones pictured. These drones are equipped
      with a companion computer that communicates to both the drone's flight computer and a base station, relaying data between the two that allows the drone to fly indoors guided by an
      Optitrack motion capture system. With the Optitrack system the drone could track or follow targets in a small space with milimeter precision. Over a summer with the help of the
      team I assembled and tuned these drones before the programming for the motion capture sytem.
