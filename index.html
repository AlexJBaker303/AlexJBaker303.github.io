    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Greetings!</p>
    <p>I am a recent graduate from the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida. I majored in electrical engineering and received my 
      bachelors degree in may of 2025. Electronics has been a long-time interest for me, so choosing to major in electrical engineering was an easy choice. 

    <p>Currently I am seeking an entry level job in electrical engineering. I am interested in the power electronics field, a field of electrical engineering based
      on high power DC or AC circuits, with a large influence on robitics, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. I enjoy hands-on tasks the most, like assembling
      circuit boards or wiring, but I also enjoy computer based design processes, for example CAD or EDA  </p>
    
    <p>I spend my spare time tinkering with things, usually electronics, sometimes other mechanical devices. Regardless of electrical or mechanical I have a desire
      to learn how things work and why things are the way that they are. Inspiration for a project usually comes from some salvaged part, I form a vision of what I think
      I can do with that part, and everything stems from there. I love the creative design process, going from a pile of parts to a finished product is fun every step of the way.
      Creating a pile of parts from a complete product is also lots of fun for me, I enjoy taking things apart as much as putting things together.
      It is a chance to learn how somebody else designed and assembled something, a chance to discover new things, and at the end of the day I have a bunch of new parts
      to be repurposed later! </p>
